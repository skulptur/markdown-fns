## Motivation
Markdown is meant for humans to type, but isn't any good when you want to abstract certain patterns that often appear in documentation. With the functions provided by markdown-fns it is not only possible but also very easy to componentize documentation!

## Get started

Install

```bash
npm install --save markdown-fns
# or
yarn add markdown-fns
```

Use

```typescript
// TODO
```

[Examples](https://github.com/skulptur/markdown-fns/tree/master/example)

## API
- Functions that can be pure, are pure.
- The argument order is optimized for partial application.
